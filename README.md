# Vue3 (Netninja tutorial)

## What is it?

This repo follows an introductory [tutorial](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/html-and-css-crash-course) by [netninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1) for [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/). Multiple projects explore the following topics:

- Vue.js's 'global', 'Options', and 'Composition' APIs,
- Parent and Child components, their lifecycles, and hooks,
- Directives, Props, and data binding (both uni- and two-way),
- Refrence Objects, including `ref()`, `reactive()`, `computed()`, and template,
- Vue.js' approach to MVC architecture in both single and multi-page applications, including the use of components and "composables"

## What you'll find here:

Project_0

- An [Intro App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_0_intro) that uses Vue.js's 'global' API in order to import basic functionality into a single-page, static page.

Project_1

- A [Modal App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_1_modals), which explores basic code modularization, directives, and databinding during the creation of "modal" components.

Project_2

- A [Reaction Timer App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_2_reaction_timer), which explores project_1's subjects in greater detail, while adding-in lifecycle hooks.

Project_3

- A [Login Form App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_3_login_form), which continues exploring the last two projects' toolset during the creation of a responsive form.

Project_4

- A [Jobs (multi-page) App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_4_jobs_multipage) synthesizing what's been learned into a multi-page 'Jobs' app, using the "Options" API.

Project_5

- A [Blogs (multi-page) App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_1_modals) synthesizing all the tools acquired in this course into a multi-page app, using the _"Composition" API_ + "Composition API"-specific hooks.

Project Notes x2

- My study [notes](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/blob/main/NOTES.md) taken during the series, and
- a [chapter/topic list](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/blob/main/VIDEO_CHAPTERS.md) for the tutorial videos.

## Why'd I do this tutorial?

My capstone needed a solid update, and I needed all the study on JS frontend frameworks, hooks, component lifecycles etc that I could get - so this tutorial series seemed like a great way to take some time and concentrate on concepts I'd only had a loose grasp on previously. Ultimately, my understanding of 'props' and 'refrences' are two gains I'm _particularly_ pleased with!

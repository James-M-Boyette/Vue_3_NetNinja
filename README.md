# Vue3 (Netninja tutorial)

### What is it?

This repo follows an introductory [tutorial](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/html-and-css-crash-course) by [netninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1) for [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/). Multiple projects explore the following topics: 
- Vue.js' 'global', 'Options', and 'Composition' APIs, 
- single and multi-page applications, 
- Vue's approach to MVC architecture, 
- Parent and Child components (and their lifecycles), 
- Props, uni- and two-way data binding, hooks, and more ... 

### What you'll find here:

- An [Intro App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_0_intro) that uses Vue.js's 'global' API in order to import basic functionality into a single-page, static page. 
- A [Modal App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_1_modals) synthesizing what I learned
- A [Reaction Timer App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_2_reaction_timer) synthesizing what I learned
- A [Login Form App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_3_login_form    ) synthesizing what I learned
- A [Jobs (multi-page) App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_4_jobs_multipage) synthesizing what I learned
- A [__ (multi-page) App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/project_1_modals) synthesizing what I learned

- My study [notes](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/blob/main/NOTES.md) taken during the series, as well as a [chapter(topic) list](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/blob/main/VIDEO_CHAPTERS.md) for the videos

### Why'd I do this tutorial?

My capstone needed a solid update, and I needed all the study on JS frontend frameworks, hooks, component lifecycles etc that I could get - so I did this excellent tutorial series, written by NetNinja.

# Vue3 (Netninja tutorial)

### This repo follows an introductory [tutorial](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/html-and-css-crash-course) by [netninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1) for [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/).

### What you'll find here:

- A [Intro App](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/tree/main/Intro) synthesizing what I learned
- My study [notes](https://github.com/sou7hernsaint/vue3_netninja/blob/main/NOTES.md) taken during the series


### How to interact with this repo:

- If you'd like to see the demo and/or my practice files, clone this repo locally and load the `demo.html` page in your browser (you will need an application like "Live server" or "Nodemon" in order to load both the CSS and HTML properly). The project runs on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), so navigate either to [localhost:8000/HTML/demo.html](http://localhost:8000/HTML/demo.html) or [localhost:5500/HTML/index.html](http://localhost:8000/HTML/index.html) to see the synthesized project or the landing page, respectively.

### Why'd I do this tutorial?

- I wanted to do a refresher on Vue before attempting to clean up my boot camp capstone project (the code, of course, was an absolute clothes pile of code, comments and half-baked ideas). Even though we touched a lot in camp, it was time to do something more focused, structured, and thoroughly-explained. Enter ðŸ¥°NetNinjaðŸ¥°

# Notes on "Composeables"

While not an official term, composables tend to encompass JavaScript functions and data you'd like to modularize and re-use in other parts of your code.

> It's nice to be able to fetch your blog post data explicitly within the 'HomeView' parent component ... but what if you need access to that data elsewhere? Composables allow you to put the fetch logic in one file, and make its variables/data exportable to any and all other components!
